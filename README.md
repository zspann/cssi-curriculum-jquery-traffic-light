In this lab, we are going to build a traffic light.

## Directions

After you fork and open this lab in your text editor, you'll also want to open `index.html` in  the browser. 

In the browser, play around with the buttons in `index.html` and see what they do.


You'll be coding your solution in `script.js`. Open up the file `script.js` file. Fill in code in each of the following sections:
  ```
  - code for button 3 -- Turn the light Yellow 
  - code for button 4 -- Turn the light Green
  - code for button 5 -- Say GO!
  - code for button 6 -- Make Green Light Blink -- Extension!!
  ```

Save your changes to `script.js`. Refresh the page in the browser to see your changes!
